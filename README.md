# git-commands

1. cteaed repository git-demo
2. added branch feature1
3. executed all necessary commands 
4. commited all to remote origin and added pull-request for review by sergeykudelin
5. readme added
Notes: didn't user https://github.com/hillel-devops-102021/hw_alem5.git just because 'remote origin ' has been already in use for next HomeTask: docker+dockerhub
but checked many additioanal commands instead of that in current repo

The Best Regards!
